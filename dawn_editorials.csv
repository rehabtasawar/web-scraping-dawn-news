Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,War and peace,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911734/war-and-peace,"May 18, 2025",Dawn,"Instead of constantly evoking the spectre of war, India and Pakistan should work towards peace.","WITH South Asia’s peace balanced on a knife-edge, it is important for national political leaders to remain grounded. In this context, it has been encouraging to see a slight shift in Islamabad’s position on the recent hostilities between India and Pakistan. At the start of last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had described the recent conflict as having ‘avenged’ the 1971 war — a claim that had startled many even in Pakistan. Towards the end of the week, however, his speeches were more moderate, with the prime minister noting at one point that past wars had given the two countries “nothing but miseries” and that there now needed to be a comprehensive dialogue.  It is encouraging that there is realisation on Pakistan’s side at least that grandstanding on the recent conflict is quite pointless, and that the frictions between the two countries still need to be addressed. Former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar had encouraged much the same in her recent remarks in parliament. Noting that India’s defeat was not a celebratory occasion, she had said, “We must all be unapologetic as a country that celebrates a ceasefire”. After all, death and destruction are never something to cheer. Arguably, it is better not to have a war than to win one. Our political leadership must not forget this. History shows that states benefit when they are able to escape the unending cycle of hostilities and focus on how they may coexist. Pakistan’s indignation is justified in that it offered India cooperation from the start, but was met with cold rejection. The people also cannot be faulted for celebrating their armed forces’ successful defence against external belligerence. At the same time, however, both Pakistan’s leadership and public must think about how future conflicts may be avoided instead of escalating to the point of all-out war. It is only fair to expect reciprocity from the other party. The Indian government must realise the folly of a violent confrontation with Pakistan every few years. War is not some theatre with which to keep the public engaged. For better or worse, the two countries are bound by a long border and a shared history and culture. India must realise that it is detrimental for its interactions with Pakistan to be dictated by New Delhi’s constant desire to establish its hegemony in the region.  The recent hostilities have yielded little apart from establishing a dangerous ‘new normal’ that could see more missiles and munitions being traded in future conflicts. What tangible benefit can the people of either country derive from this? Instead of constantly evoking the spectre of war, the governments of both countries should work towards peace. The people of the subcontinent will one day thank them for it."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Unequal taxation,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911733/unequal-taxation,"May 18, 2025",Dawn,"PAKISTAN’S inefficient, growth-inhibiting, distortive and unjust tax system can justifiably be described as the...","PAKISTAN’S inefficient, growth-inhibiting, distortive and unjust tax system can justifiably be described as the country’s Achilles heel. Not only is it the root cause of the nation’s fiscal troubles and mounting debt, its role in the endless balance-of-payment crises, leading to continuous boom-and-bust cycles, has also proved damaging. Now, under the IMF’s oversight, the tax authorities are scrambling to meet elevated annual tax collection targets to ensure that the country achieves the primary budget surplus goal of the ongoing $7bn loan. In other words, tax targets, which were previously set to meet public sector expenditures, are now being revised to contain the burgeoning fiscal deficit and reduce the rising debt stock. The problem, however, is that our fiscal policymakers have already squeezed existing taxpayers dry and the political leadership does not appear to be able to net elements outside the system — retail, real estate, agriculture, etc — because of their political clout. For this year, the FBR had imposed Rs1.3tr worth of new taxes — mostly on salaried individuals and the corporate sector — to plug the gap between the IMF-given target and the amount it could otherwise recover. For the next year, the IMF believes the tax gap will stand at around Rs1tr, which means additional taxation would be required to meet the proposed target of Rs14.3tr in FY26. While media reports suggest that the multilateral lending agency has narrowed its focus in the new budget to concentrate mainly on additional tax measures to achieve the new target, it remains unclear if the government plans to cover this gap by extracting more from existing taxpayers or finally tighten the noose around the sacred cows. The demerits of the FBR’s tax transformation plan apart, the government is facing stiff opposition from the country’s powerful business lobbies, which include textile owners, cement producers and traders who oppose the implementation of some of the measures suggested. The government is said to be working on providing ‘tax relief’ to salaried individuals. But that would hardly be possible unless those who are not paying their dues and are, in effect, stealing from the government are brought into the tax net. This is necessary to create space for the provision of relief to those most in need of it. It is about time that the government penalised the tax evaders, instead of taking more money from the despairing salaried class."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Health crimes,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911732/health-crimes,"May 18, 2025",Dawn,"MULTAN’S Nishtar Hospital, south Punjab’s largest public-sector hospital, was in the news last year for...","MULTAN’S Nishtar Hospital, south Punjab’s largest public-sector hospital, was in the news last year for outrageous negligence that caused a patient’s death by HIV/ AIDS, while 30 others contracted the infection during dialysis. An inquiry committee set up by the provincial government had confirmed the infections at the hospital’s nephrology department; it has now proposed penalties comprising fines, censure and demotions for the facility’s senior officials, along with the removal, and “forfeiture of past one year’s service” of the Nishtar Medical University’s vice chancellor. The investigation, conducted under the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006, recorded grave discrepancies in supervision, protocol conformity and patient care by the VC and other accused personnel. Although delayed, this development should serve as a warning for corrupt practitioners and remind others of accountability processes. The health scandals at the hospital — in 2022, four decomposing corpses were found on its roof — are indicators of the detrimental impact of unethical medics and staff in the absence of accountability mechanisms. Scarcity of funds aggravates the predicament. Presently, Pakistan is second among nations with the sharpest rise in HIV cases in the Asia-Pacific region. This virus, stalked by shame, is already a complicated battle. We have a long way to go before societal attitudes become more compassionate towards patients, which will encourage them to report their symptoms and seek treatment. Without consistent treatment, HIV can convert into AIDS and devastate the immune system. But, other than socioeconomic forces, the scale of torturous events that frequently come to light across Pakistan, and their potential spread, imply that the virus may now be difficult to contain. It is crucial for the federal and provincial authorities to view this as a health emergency and enforce immediate preventive measures. Our medical structure should not resemble an abattoir."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Tariff reform,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911546/tariff-reform,"May 17, 2025",Dawn,Planned import policy reforms signify a major positive shift in the govt’s economic and growth strategy.,"THE planned import policy reforms to recalibrate tariffs in line with Pakistan’s industrialisation and export aims signify a major positive shift in the government’s economic and growth strategy. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has approved a roadmap to drastically slash average customs tariffs from 19pc to 9.5pc in the next five years, besides eliminating decades-old distortive tariff protections for carmakers, steel producers, textiles manufacturers, the chemical sector, and others against foreign competition. Another key reform focuses on reducing the number of existing custom duty slabs from five to four, with peak tariffs lowered from 20pc to 15pc. The roadmap also envisages doing away with numerous regulatory and additional taxes on thousands of imported items to bring certainty, transparency and uniformity to cascading margins. The reforms are expected to boost exports by $5bn once the adjustments are phased in, starting with the next budget.  More importantly, the lower tariff barriers will go a long way in helping Pakistan integrate into the global economy with considerable ease. The tariff reforms should also boost our industrial competitiveness, and allow manufacturers to become part of global supply chains by giving them greater access to raw materials and semi-finished goods. Trade policy professionals generally agree that the high import taxes are a regressive form of taxation as they make businesses more inward-looking, thus creating an anti-export bias in the overall economic policy framework. Our tariff policy is a testament to that. For decades, we have imposed some of the highest tariffs, a major reason why Pakistan has failed to move to manufacturing high-quality, value-added goods. And regionally, its export-to-GDP ratio remains one of the lowest. High import tariffs and the inability to acquire goods that can support technological progress exacerbate the economic challenges. Indeed, there are concerns that lower tariffs, which Pakistan has until now used as a major source of tax revenue collection rather than for industrialisation and export growth, would lead to higher imports and, ultimately, to another balance-of-payments crisis. But such concerns are exaggerated and are being raised by those who have made money using tariff protections. There is no doubt that imports would rise but exports will grow at a much faster pace, reducing trade deficit and creating more jobs.  However, the assumption that a reformed tariff policy can do the magic on its own is misplaced. Although Pakistan’s import taxes remain higher than its peers, these have come down considerably since the early 1990s when the country embarked upon the path to economic and trade liberalisation. Yet the fall in the average tariffs since then has not translated into proportionate export growth or significant integration into the global economy. This means there also are other policies that need to be fixed along with tariffs."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Rising heat,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911545/rising-heat,"May 17, 2025",Dawn,"AS the mercury continues to rise mercilessly across Pakistan, it becomes painfully clear that climate change has hit...","AS the mercury continues to rise mercilessly across Pakistan, it becomes painfully clear that climate change has hit us hard. The country will have to endure recurring cycles of deadly heat, which will likely intensify. Each year, the toll on lives and livelihoods grows heavier, while our preparedness lags dangerously behind. While a westerly system may offer some relief next week, the immediate focus must remain on protecting vulnerable communities and strengthening long-term resilience. The Met Department has warned that temperatures will remain 4°C to 7°C above normal in many regions, with parts of southern Punjab and Sindh already experiencing highs above 45°C. In Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has ramped up emergency measures, directing hospitals to set up dedicated heatwave counters and stock lifesaving medicines. Clean drinking water is being ensured in high-risk areas like Cholistan, and public awareness campaigns have been launched. However, in many remote and underserved areas, the state’s presence remains worryingly thin, leaving citizens to fend for themselves. Such short-term responses, while necessary, are not enough. Heatwaves are becoming a grim new normal driven by global warming. To navigate this reality, resilience must be built at both community and institutional levels. In the immediate term, citizens must follow official advisories: avoid outdoor exposure between 10am and 4pm, wear light-coloured, breathable clothing, stay hydrated, and use oral rehydration solutions to prevent dehydration. Vulnerable groups — children, the elderly, pregnant women, outdoor labourers, and those with chronic illnesses — require special attention. Employers must adjust working hours and provide shaded rest areas. Early signs of heatstroke should never be ignored; immediate cooling and professional medical care can save lives. Looking ahead, urban centres must adapt by expanding shaded public spaces, ensuring uninterrupted water supply, and enforcing labour protections during peak heat hours. Health systems, particularly in rural areas, must be strengthened to cope with rising cases of heat-related illnesses. At the policy level, climate adaptation must be treated as an urgent national priority. Investments in early warning systems, green infrastructure such as urban forests and cool roofs, the revival of traditional water reservoirs, and wide-reaching public education campaigns are critical. Heatwaves will return, each more punishing than the last. Building resilience has become a matter of survival in a dangerously warming world."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Missing link,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911544/missing-link,"May 17, 2025",Dawn,"FINANCE Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb now has much to his credit, which is why his promise that the M6 motorway will ...","FINANCE Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb now has much to his credit, which is why his promise that the M6 motorway will be completed “at all costs” gives one hope that there may be some progress on this long-awaited project in the coming financial year. “[…] We will ensure the planning ministry is fully informed of the motorway’s importance so that appropriate budgetary provisions are made,” he recently assured parliament while dwelling on the government’s development plans for fiscal 2026. It is a wonder that the M6 motorway, which will link Karachi to Sukkur, still exists only on paper. Considering the size of the port city and its importance to the national economy, Karachi ought to have been the first city to be linked to other urban and industrial centres when the motorways were conceived. Instead, in 2025, road travellers do not have access to a reliable, well-maintained, high-speed motorway that links the country to Pakistan’s main commercial hub, and must use highways in frequent need of repairs. Meanwhile, almost all the other important urban centres of the country, barring Quetta, have been connected via motorways for many years, which has greatly facilitated travel, trade and transport. Even now, six years from when it was supposed to become operational, it seems the M6 will take another few years to operationalise despite the finance minister’s sincere promises. Mr Aurangzeb revealed the authorities are still exploring funding options for the M6 project, and while international financial institutions have shown an interest in financing the motorway, there is still nothing that seems to have been firmed up. ‘Unsolicited’ proposals for the project, submitted by two firms earlier this year, seem to have been ignored by the authorities, and it seems that no real progress has been made over the past many years that would benefit road travellers. Sindh’s representatives should continue raising the issue forcefully, or the project will keep being pushed back."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Budgeting austerity,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911281/budgeting-austerity,"May 16, 2025",Dawn,The past policy of squeezing salaried classes and fully documented corporations to collect taxes will not work any longer.,"THE initial discussions between the IMF and Pakistan on the upcoming budget suggest that the multilateral agency is not going to relent on the core condition of its current $7bn financing facility: a tight fiscal policy. That was not unexpected. With the country living off repeated bailouts from the lender, it is but natural that its economic policies are tightly tied to the programme goal aimed at ensuring debt reduction and sustainability — in times of war and peace both. Starting Wednesday, the virtual technical-level discussions, which precede formal policy-level talks on the budget from May 19, have revealed tentative fiscal, inflation, growth and other targets that our policymakers will be required to meet next year to stay in the programme. Media reports say that the Fund expects Pakistan’s moribund economy to expand by 3.6pc next year, with headline consumer inflation averaging at 7.7pc, and total federal and provincial tax and non-tax revenues growing to nearly Rs20tr or 15.2pc of the economy’s size. The IMF proposals also emphasise austerity by tightening controls on current and development expenditure to reduce the budget deficit from 5.6pc of the economy’s size estimated for the present fiscal year to 5.1pc next year.  Related to this is the hefty increase suggested in primary surplus from 1pc to 1.6pc of GDP in order to ensure sustainable debt servicing and bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26. The next budget will also map climate relevance in adaptation, mitigation and transition to receive the IMF’s climate-related funding of $1.4bn in the next 28 months. Data for the current fiscal year shows that Pakistan is on track to meeting budget targets and other time-bound structural benchmarks agreed with the Fund. Cooperation from the provinces has proved critical in pulling off many of these goals. However, a significant increase in the revenue target proposed for next year amid a shortfall in tax revenues this year underlines the need for broadening the tax base by effectively bringing retail, real estate, agriculture and other undertaxed or untaxed areas of the economy into the net. This demands political commitment and substantial efforts by both the federal and provincial governments. The decision to pull the government out of the wheat market this year despite opposition from the rural elite, and to cut energy subsidies for powerful textile and other manufacturers, shows that the state has what it takes to make tough decisions. The past policy of squeezing the salaried classes and fully documented corporations to collect taxes will not work any longer. Failure to reform the corrupt and inefficient tax system has already taken a huge toll on ordinary people and led to large cuts in spending on the development of infrastructure crucial for future economic growth and stability."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,A ‘new’ Syria,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911280/a-new-syria,"May 16, 2025",Dawn,"THE American embrace of the post-Assad Syrian regime is complete, with President Donald Trump meeting the Arab...","THE American embrace of the post-Assad Syrian regime is complete, with President Donald Trump meeting the Arab state’s interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh on Wednesday, and announcing that US sanctions against Syria will be lifted. It should be remembered that not too long ago, there was a $10m US bounty on Mr Sharaa’s head, when he was more popularly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the feared head of the Al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front. But in geopolitics there are ‘good’ militants and ‘bad’ militants, and to the Americans, the Syrian leader clearly falls in the former category. Mr Sharaa was instrumental in overthrowing Bashar al-Assad’s brutal regime, which had long been a shared goal of the Americans, many states in Europe, as well as the Gulf Arabs. This effectively reversed the tide of Iranian and Russian influence in Syria. Therefore, the audience with Mr Trump, and the removal of sanctions, is a reward for the ex-militant’s ‘services’. Contrast this with the treatment meted out to the Afghan Taliban. The hard-line rulers of Kabul remain sanctioned by the US, and unrecognised by the global community. The Taliban are ideologically of similar stock as Ahmed al-Sharaa; but while the latter helped the US and West bring down a geopolitical foe, the former forced the US-led coalition to quit Afghanistan after a futile two-decade nation-building mission. Mr Trump also asked the Syrian ruler to recognise Israel. However, there was no word of Israel vacating Syrian territory it has occupied for decades, including the Golan Heights, and more land it seized after the Assad government fell. It is indeed positive for sanctions to be lifted, and it is hoped that this helps bring relief to the Syrian people. But the selective rebranding and ‘dry-cleaning’ of those once labelled as terrorists by the West reeks of hypocrisy and self-interest. While Mr Sharaa has promised an inclusive state, he himself remains surrounded by extremist elements. Over the past few months, there have been bloody confrontations between pro-government fighters, and members of the Alawi and Druze communities. It would be a shame for the Syrian people if the Assad autocracy were to be replaced by an extremist state. Right now there are few signs that Damascus is on the path of inclusivity and progress, regardless of the newfound confidence the US has in Syria’s current rulers."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Business of begging,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911279/business-of-begging,"May 16, 2025",Dawn,"IT is a matter of deep embarrassment that Pakistan has become an ‘exporter’ of beggars.

Over 5,000 have been deported from Saudi Arabia alone in the last 16 months, while others have been booted out of Iraq, the UAE, Qatar and Malaysia. These and other numbers were shared recently by the interior minister while responding to a question in parliament. He disclosed that nearly 52pc of these deportees hail from Sindh, followed by Punjab and KP. With foreign governments tightening their visa regimes and publicly shaming us by deporting such large numbers, one must ask: what is our own government doing to tackle this crisis at home? While placing over 4,000 beggars on the Exit Control List may appear as decisive action, it addresses only the symptom, not the cause. The reality is that the ‘begging mafia’ thrives not only due to governance failures but also entrenched poverty and the state’s inability to generate viable employment. With millions of beggars across the country reportedly pulling in billions per year, this is not just a social ill, it is a well-oiled economy. We must break this cycle. To begin with, a crackdown is needed on trafficking networks. If the ‘illegal’ Afghans were rounded up with such vigour, so can such trafficking rings. In addition, the government must rehabilitate those forced into begging through skill development, microfinance initiatives, and targeted social welfare programmes. It would also do well to establish vocational centres in Karachi, interior Sindh and south Punjab, where organised begging is most pronounced. The authorities must impose strict penalties on those who exploit the vulnerable for profit. Provincial governments must play their part by strengthening child protection units and launching sustained anti-begging awareness campaigns at the community level. The public should also realise that their charitable spirit is being exploited by criminals. This disgraceful ‘business’ must end."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Rebuilding trust,https://www.dawn.com/news/1911137/rebuilding-trust,"May 15, 2025",Dawn,Both countries will have to restart the dialogue process. One major step India can take would be to honour the IWT.,"AFTER the cessation of hostilities following Saturday’s US-brokered ceasefire, it will take time, effort and political will to rebuild trust between Pakistan and India. Though US President Donald Trump suggested that both states “go out and have a nice dinner together”, a dinner date is unlikely to melt away nearly eight decades of mistrust and animosity. Moreover, the Indian prime minister’s combative rhetoric in the speech to his nation on Monday also indicates that New Delhi will take a more hawkish line towards Islamabad. Narendra Modi said that a “new normal” had been established, which entailed India taking military action against so-called terrorist targets in Pakistan. Mr Modi’s bellicosity seems to stem from rising domestic criticism, particularly over American involvement in de-escalation efforts. It is hoped that better sense prevails, as this Indian strategy is a recipe for disaster, and will lead South Asia into a destructive cycle of violence.  Whether it is with the help of foreign interlocutors — which the Indians oppose — or through bilateral channels, both states will have to restart the dialogue process, if perpetual conflict is to be avoided. PM Modi said that dialogue with Pakistan will only focus on terrorism and Azad Kashmir. If these are India’s main talking points, then it should be prepared to discuss all forms of terrorism in South Asia, including attempts by New Delhi to destabilise Pakistan through acts of terrorism. Moreover, the talks should not remain limited to Azad Kashmir and should in fact include discussions on the entire internationally disputed territory. The Indian political class has taken umbrage at Donald Trump’s efforts to broker peace, with leaders saying that all disputes must be resolved under the umbrella of bilateralism, with many citing the 1972 Simla accord as the main blueprint for managing Pakistan-Indian relations. If Simla — signed between Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi — is the yardstick, then India should remember that the agreement says, in black and white, that pending the final settlement of bilateral disputes, “neither side shall alter the situation”.  The BJP government’s unilateral scrapping of Article 370 in held Kashmir has significantly altered the situation. Moreover, the Simla accord also foresees “a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir”. Pakistan has been consistently calling for Kashmir to be discussed, but the BJP regime is not interested in talking about the dispute. Instead of a ‘new normal’ that sows the seeds of mutually assured destruction, forward thinking is needed to resolve Pakistan-India disputes. As matters cool down, small steps should be taken to rebuild confidence, and establish a less bellicose discourse. One major step India can take would be to honour the Indus Waters Treaty, as Pakistan cannot afford to have its rightful share of water blocked."

With the nation basking in the afterglow of Pakistan’s successful military engagement with India, there is an opportunity to quickly heal certain internal vulnerabilities. This, of course, is a reference to the bitter social and political divisions created over past years as various actors have vied for influence and control over the nation’s governance structure. As the events of the past week have taught us, no matter how strongly opposed they remain in ideological terms, all actors are steadfast and united while confronting any crisis that threatens the sovereignty of Pakistan. This realisation seems to have been missing from the national political discourse for some time now, and it is good fortune that it has now come to the fore. With feelings of national pride at their strongest in many years, the environment is particularly amenable for all stakeholders to set aside their personal differences, even if momentarily, and extend each other a hand of reconciliation. Doing so quickly will send a strong message to those hoping to prey on the country’s internal divisions. The stand-off last week has underlined an existential imperative to strengthen Pakistan’s defences in all domains. The country must be as strong internally as it is externally. The citizenry needs to be united under a shared social and political vision, and the state needs to create space for opportunities that promote economic growth and equitable prosperity. The fruits of a stabilising social and economic realignment will ensure that the military has access to the resources it needs to keep an edge over Pakistan’s adversaries.There is no knowing when the next crisis will present itself, so there is little time to waste. At a time when nationalist fervour is high, forgiveness can be easy. A process for political reconciliation should be set in motion immediately, and social movements representing disillusioned segments of society must be approached and given a sympathetic ear. Political prisoners should be released forthwith to foster goodwill within society. It seems, at this juncture, that Pakistan can be set on a positive trajectory with little extra effort. The opportunity must not be wasted. The country has received a reality check that should shake it out of its perpetual internecine conflicts. An off-ramp is available that may help defuse many crises. It should be taken."

While the ouster of Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government and the formation of an interim civilian-led administration under Dr Muhammad Yunus brought hopes of a peaceful democratic transition, recent developments have cast a shadow over the credibility of the promised elections. The decision to suspend the Awami League’s registration and bar it from participating in the polls is concerning. No matter how serious the allegations against the former prime minister and her party, credible elections demand inclusivity. The Awami League, as Bangladesh’s oldest political party with deep roots in the country’s history, cannot simply be erased from the political landscape. It remains a political reality with a large support base. Banning it from participating in elections risks destabilising Bangladesh’s fragile democracy and disenfranchising a significant portion of its electorate. India may have its own vested interests in opposing the ban, but the fact remains that excluding a major political force will only fuel claims of bias and deepen political divisions at a time when unity is most needed. The international community will also be closely watching whether Dhaka can deliver on its promise of free, fair and inclusive elections. The interim government must remember that its primary mandate is to oversee a peaceful and legitimate transfer of power. That goal cannot be achieved if political rivalries are settled through bans rather than the ballot. Dr Yunus must demonstrate his commitment to democratic ideals by ensuring all parties — including the Awami League — are given a level playing field. Setting a clear timeline for elections and guaranteeing the participation of all political actors will not only bolster the legitimacy of the next government but also help stave off the danger of a military intervention. Bangladesh’s future must be decided at the ballot box — not in courtrooms or through political decrees."
Pakistan,Dawn,Editorial,Crisis averted,https://www.dawn.com/news/1910938/crisis-averted,"May 14, 2025",Dawn,"As nuclear nations, both countries must wield their powers with utmost responsibility and immense restraint.","AS Pakistan and India count their casualties, tend to the wounded and grieve the fallen, the leaderships of the two nations, as well as their people, must ask themselves whether perennial conflict is in their individual interests. The military confrontations between the two nations last week provided just a small glimpse into the destruction that can be unleashed on both sides of the border in the event of an all-out war. The American president, who brokered a ceasefire between the two, has remarked that his administration helped prevent a nuclear exchange.  If hostilities had reached that point, the leaderships of India and Pakistan would have failed their most fundamental duty: to prevent catastrophe. As nuclear nations, both countries have a duty to wield their powers with utmost responsibility and immense restraint. It is in the strategic interest of both nations to avoid all-out war, and ceasefires are not concessions but necessary steps to prevent irreparable damage. The Indian government’s decision to escalate hostilities by striking mainland Pakistan was dangerously provocative and must be seen as a grave miscalculation. Matters were not helped by the gleeful cheerleading for the ensuing violence by the media on both sides of the border. The pressure to attack and counter-attack kept growing, till, it seems, both countries were ready to launch full-scale hostilities against each other. In retrospect, the region narrowly avoided calamity: we are now being told we were on the brink of a nuclear war. Citizens of both countries need to understand what that would have entailed.  Should nuclear weapons ever be used, the consequences would be catastrophic beyond imagination. For all those who survive, the fallout will guarantee a life of unimaginable misery. Within hours, a region with millennia of shared history, culture and civilisation would be reduced to rubble. Major cities on both sides would be annihilated. The bombs would spare no one: men and women, young and old. Over the following week, tens of millions more will die from their injuries or radiation sickness. Disease and starvation on a cataclysmic scale will follow as the subcontinent’s health and food supply infrastructure collapses. The effects will not be confined to this region alone: the bombs and the ensuing fires will release dangerous and radioactive pollutants in the air, which will circulate around the world, triggering a ‘nuclear winter’ and decimating agricultural output. Billions more would be at risk of famine. The issues between the two countries seem manageable in comparison. Perhaps it is wiser and simpler to work on them than to risk the end of the world. International diplomacy may have halted escalation in this instance, but durable peace can only come from the political will and wisdom of leaders in both India and Pakistan. That responsibility cannot be outsourced."

This is important because Israel has — for decades — commanded reverential bipartisan support in Washington, and very few American politicians would dare take on Tel Aviv. There are several indications that the Trump administration is charting its own course vis-à-vis Israel. For example, the US has secured the release of an American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas, considered a ‘foreign terrorist entity’ by the US, by negotiating with the Palestinian group and bypassing Israel. Moreover, as he pursues multibillion-dollar business deals in the Gulf, Mr Trump has reportedly dropped his demand that Riyadh recognise Tel Aviv. The Saudis have said normalisation would only be possible once Israel commits to an independent Palestinian state, which currently seems impossible as the Zionist state carries out a genocidal purge in Gaza. Also, Washington has worked out a ceasefire with Yemen’s Houthis — on the US ‘terrorist’ list as well — much to Israel’s chagrin. The Houthis have been lobbing missiles at Israel apparently in defence of Gaza, while Tel Aviv has undertaken savage bombing runs against Yemen. As for the ongoing talks between the US and Iran, this is probably one of Tel Aviv’s biggest headaches. Though Mr Trump has made inflammatory remarks about bombing Iran, he has publicly said he prefers a negotiated settlement. Israel, on the other hand, wants to fight Iran to the last American. Therefore, all these seemingly independent American decisions are causing much grief within Israel. However, it would be overly optimistic to consider this a rupture between the US and Israel. After all, several of Donald Trump’s financiers, supporters and members of his inner circle are staunch Zionists. Yet it is also true that the MAGA wing of Mr Trump’s support base wants nothing to do with Middle Eastern wars. Therefore, the seemingly changed approach towards Israel most likely reflects internal dynamics rather than any external considerations. Mr Trump is also known for his U-turns. He could be opposed to US involvement in foreign wars today. But if his Zionist supporters catch his ear, the US bombers and aircraft carriers may be ready for the next forever war in the Middle East."

Postponed last week following escalating Pakistan-India tensions, the remaining eight matches of the season will be played from May 17 with the final to be contested eight days later. The dates were announced by Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi after a US-brokered ceasefire agreement was reached with India over the weekend. The resumption of the glitzy T20 tournament follows that of the Indian Premier League across the border, which was also suspended, and will provide the nation an outlet following days of tension. The PSL, the PCB’s financial lifeline and a prime-time national attraction, had been targeted by India, with one of its drones crashing outside the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium hours before a match was to be played there last week. Keeping in view the security situation, and the well-being of the foreign players, the PCB — hastily and perhaps due to lack of better judgement — announced it would shift the tournament to the UAE. But with the country on the brink of war at the time, course correction came when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif rightly ordered that the remainder of the competition be postponed until the situation improved. The move to postpone PSL, however, came after Board of Control for Cricket in India decided to suspend the IPL — stating that the nation took precedent over cricket — with reports across the border suggesting that the BCCI had asked its UAE counterparts to not allow the PCB to host the matches on its grounds. There were also reports across the border that the foreign players, who had left Pakistan on a chartered flight after the PSL was postponed, had said they would never come back to the country. None of that has happened. The foreign players are returning, including the Australians who had been reported as being sceptical about it, and the PSL, the country’s favourite pastime, is set for a grandstand finish."
